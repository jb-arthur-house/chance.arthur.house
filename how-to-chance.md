## overview
- chance will lay on the couch all the time. 

## schedule
##### Thursday, 11/24
- when you can: come over and say hi, give him grub, and let him outside.
- bedtime: let him outside

##### Friday, 11/25
- wake up: let him outside
- 11AM: feed him, and let him outside
- we'll be back in the afternoon

## outside
- he'll go out the back door, but sometimes needs encouragement or company. 
	- he's scared of the dark, and sometimes doesn't admit to needing to pee. 
- if he *needs* to go outside (hasn't in a while), tell him to "go pee" or "go outside". 
	- walk him out through the back porch, stand at the doorway or go into the yard with him
	- don't throw his ball or encourage other behavior apart from "go pee"
- he'll bark into the void in order to attract company
	- you can shout curses at him out the back door if it'll make you feel better. 

## food & water
- water is in bowls in the dining room and the living room
	- you can fill them up/rinse them out in the bathtub, if that's easy. or kitchen sink. 
- food is in the cupboard between the living room and dining room
	- chance's bowl is the big bowl
	- he might need encouragement to get off the couch or stand up, but he generally wants to eat and will eat it all. 
	- after chance eats, he probably wants to go outside (and maybe hang out with you out there)

## if he falls down
- he occasionally collapses, especially on the hard floors. 
	- he'll scrabble and whine because his back legs aren't strong enough
- help him up!
	- if you grab him under his belly and pull up while he's trying he'll be able to get up again
	- he might cry during it.
